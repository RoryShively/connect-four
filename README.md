# Play connect four on the command line... by yourself!

Bored while waiting for a build? Bored in general? Play connect four in the terminal!

All your friends will either think you're cool, or insane. Either way, you win!

### How to Play

First make sure you have Python 3 in your PATH - I developed this using Python version 3.5, but any version of Python 3 ought to work. If not, feel free to submit an issue and let me know!

To run, first clone the repo.

Once cloned, cd into the base directory:

`cd connect-four`

Then run it!

`python3 connectfour.py`

Anytime you want the game to end, type in `exit` as your column choice. Or just do it the old fashioned way with a Control+C.

Enjoy!
